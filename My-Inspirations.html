                    <h1>I <strong>REALLY</strong> like SILENT HILL 2!</h1>
                    <p>
                        The game is rich in atmosphere, the story continues to keep a player wondering why James is in
                        Silent Hill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game is also terrifying in a unique way. There are many times where a player may be tricked
                        into thinking something is there, watching, when really there is nothing at all, just
                        atmosphere.

                        The games OST is also incredibly memorable, some tracks being used in remixes to this day. It
                        invokes a plethora of different feelings within the player.

                        This game means an incredible amount to me, in both story and game mechanics. The world you see
                        in this game, broken and desolate, is a direct inspiration for 'Project: S'
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The world of Gaia is wasting away due to Shinra, the planet's biggest corporation, is draining
                        it dry of its life, Mako. The game lays the stakes on thick, and is rarely ever afraid to show
                        you the consequences on both sides of the conflict. This is something I desired to show within
                        the world of Project: S, a world where it's inhabitants are ruled under an iron fist as they all
                        slowly waste away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The music is incredibly memorable, and at the time was revolutionary. The track "One-Winged
                        Angel" was one of the only tracks in a video game to contain real vocals, this gave the final
                        showdown with Sephiroth the importance it truly deserved, and made me and many other players
                        truly feel like you were battling the inevitable.

                        The combat is incredibly simple, though a hard thing to truly master. The game gives you
                        baseline mechanics, and it's up to you as the player to build on those mechanics and push the
                        boundaries of what you can do. There are thousands of Materia combinations that a player could
                        discover during a playthrough. The limit breaks were a great way to build upon what was seen in
                        FINAL FANTASY VI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The visuals, while they may be dated now, at the time were something to be marvelled at. While
                        the FINAL FANTASY franchise up until this point did have a following in the West, it was this
                        insatllment that kicked the franchise into the mainstream.
