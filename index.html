        <h2 class="indexheader">What is 'Endless Summer'?</h2>
        <p>
            Endless Summer is an idea created by myself, it tells the story of descendants from those who survived the
            witch trials during the 15th - 18th century. Every party member has very different ways of life, and they're
            united by one goal; to stop the tragedy of Endless Summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tragedy of Endless Summer is a psychic wave that sends those without the will to live into a murderous
            frenzy, or into a deep sleep, both outcomes resulting in eventual death. This is a last effort from the
            biggest corporations in the world to take control of the Earth's remaining resources and fix the planet.
        </p>
        <h2 class="indexheader">What sort of game is it?</h2>
        <p>
            As of right now, Endless Summer is set out to be a turn-based RPG without a traditional magic system, and
            presenting a unique way of thinking about turn-based combat.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to create a world where the combat system fits right into place, this is why im still experimenting
            with ideas from many kinds of systems from different genres.
        </p>
        <h2 class="indexheader">What is the world like?</h2>
        <p>
            The world is set in 2040, only 15 years away. The idea is to try and create a realistic imagining of just
            how different the world could be in just that amount of time, to consider the technological advancements
            that are being made in many fields of work and how it will influence us.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also the element of fantasy, through phsycic visions due to an experimental super drug and a spiritual world buried deep within the Earth's core. Though the aim
            is to try and remain grounded, excluding fantasy weapons such as the 'Buster Sword', an easily recognisable
            weapon in a fantasy setting. Instead, our party members fight with generic tools such as spanners,
            sledgehammers, and improvised sharp objects used as knives.
        </p>
        <p>
            These elements are created in such a way that a player may believe that the humans are truly sucking up the Earth's last
            resources, no longer allowing for more easily accessible weapons such as swords and traditional firearms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Animals and plant life can be scarce in many remaining countries, and this is due to the major pollution
            problem seen throughout the world.
