        <h2>What is 'Endless Summer'?</h2>
        <p>
            Endless Summer is an idea created by myself, it tells the story of descendants from those who survived the
            witch trials during the 15th - 18th century. Every party member has very different ways of life, and they're
            united by one goal; to stop the tragedy of Endless Summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tragedy of Endless Summer is a psychic wave that sends those without the will to live into a murderous
            frenzy, or into a deep sleep, both outcomes resulting in eventual death. This is a last effort from the
            biggest corporations in the world to take control of the Earth's remaining resources and fix the planet.
        </p>
        <h2>What sort of game is it?</h2>
        <p>As of right now, Endless Summer is set out to be a turn-based RPG without a traditional magic system, and presenting a unique way of thinking about turn-based combat.</p>
