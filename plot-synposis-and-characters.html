        <h2>Who are the characters?</h2>
        <p>As of now, these character's names are not chosen. Though some of them do have a defined backstory!</p>
        <h3>The Protagonist</h3>
        <p>
            Our protagonist has a 'glass half empty' look on the planet. He's been relocated to the remains of Europe
            with his mother, as his home country has effectively turned into an uninhabitable wasteland where the only
            human thing left is the Savage.
        </p>
        <p>
            He has a deep physical conflict within himself. On one hand, he's been infected with a disease that is
            rampaging across the planet with no publically known treatments. On the other, he has ties with a series of
            Government doctors that give him an experimental drug in exchange for his services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only thing he knows about this drug is that it makes him stronger, unnaturally so. Though perhaps he
            will discover the consequences of taking this miracle cure?
        </p>
        <h3>Second Party Member</h3>
        <p>
            The second fighter, a girl. She lives in Virtual Suburbia with our protagonist, and has started to
            experience strange visions, and see things she could almost swear was real.
        </p>
        <p>
            As she progresses with the rest of the party, she begins to realise her fear of becoming part of the frenzy
            if Endless Summer begins due to experiencing the same kind of things that those without the will to live
            experience; Visions, and prophetic dreams.
