        <h1>I <strong>REALLY</strong> like SILENT HILL 2!</h1>
        <p>The game is atmospheric, the story continues to keep a player wondering why James is in Silent Hill.</p>
        <p>
            The game is also terrifying in a unique way. There are many times where a player may be tricked into
            thinking something is there, watching, when really there is nothing at all, just atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            The games OST is also incredibly memorable, some tracks being used in remixes to this day. It invokes a
            plethora of different feelings within the player.
