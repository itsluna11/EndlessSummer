            <h1>All About Me!</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Luna, I'm a transgender developer in the making who really, REALLY, loves pizza. My
                pronouns are she/her.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been playing games my whole life, I even remember my first game; 'Scooby Doo: Night of 100 Frights'
                (go play it, it's really good I promise). Although my passion for games didn't truly kick off until I
                was nine years old seeing 'Final Fantasy' for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Final Fantasy' showed me the many different ways that a fantasy world could be done, it's a franchise
                that's evolved greatly over its many entries. Think of the stark differences between Final Fantasy VII
                and IX; The settings are completely different, one being set in a dying planet and the other in a
                medieval time period, being slowly torn up. While still being in the same franchise, one could glance
                and assume otherwise which is more than likely a contributing reason to why there's so many fans. There
                is a Final Fantasy game for <strong>you.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many games that I've played that have inspired me to create stories, the idea that I can
                captivate and evoke certain emotions in a person is a great inspiration. UNDERTALE was the game that
                first done this for me, the messages that it presented to players is very important, that violence
                doesn't always have to be the other option, that there are other ways to win.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also inspires me to take many of the real life situations that I've been in, good and bad, and to put
                it out there in the world as an important message.
            </p>
            <h2>What am I currently doing?</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment, I'm currently in education studying digital design/development for games. Some of the
                important units I do are; Narrative/Character Design, Mobile Apps, and Web Technologies (which requires
                me to program this website!). I chose this course because I belive that the things covered will help me
                greatly in writing my story, and then eventually bringing it to life. It's a course that allows me to
                employ my own creativitiy within almost every aspect of my work, which lets me personally engage with
                the things that I'm doing.
            </p>
            <h2>Where do I plan to go?</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment, the idea of going into my own indie studio is interesting. Again, with the idea that I
                can pursue ideas with my own creative freedom. Although there are a few big studios in Scotland that I
                could look to work for as a start in a future career.
