                    <p>
                        Welcome! This is a page that will be used to document any major development processes for any
                        additions related to this big project.
                    </p>

                        Currently, what I'm getting up to is writing out a baseline for the story. I've written up a
                        setting, outlined my main themes seen throughout the story, and incorporated the overall message
                        of sustainability (as per the project brief!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've outlined who some of my characters are, though none of them have any defined names yet. The
                        character that I've worked the most on is the protagonist; a young man with a sledgehammer and
                        far too many issues to count. He's pushed towards a journey he feels conflicted being a part of,
                        preferring to fix his own physical and mental issues. He believes that he can help no one, for
                        he struggles to help himself
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My second character is one of the first party members you will recruit during the story, a woman
                        slightly older than our protagonist. Her last family has passed away, and she's starting to see
                        strange visions. She fears becoming someone without the 'Will' to control themself, and sets out
                        to figure out why the masses have suddenly came down with their bout of insanity.

                        On the side, I've been working on a short mobile pitch for my college work. This is helping me
                        out incredible amounts when it comes to better defining the mystical aspect of this world, I had
                        the idea that if someone else will be undertaking the pitch, it should be fun and interesting
                        for them to make. Defining the mystical aspects of this world could be a very good way to
                        achieve that. Seeing how someone else views my world is also a good way to build my project by
                        having that outsider's perspective.
